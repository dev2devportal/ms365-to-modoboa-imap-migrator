This is an earlier prototype with static variables hardcoded into the script, rather than separated out.
The scripts can only run one account at atime, rather than a list of accounts.
You must edit the variables near the top to make this work with your configuration.
Run the migration (download) script first.
Then only after that is complete, and you verify it looks like a complete replication, then run the upload script.
These are still imperfect, but help in the process of moving whole accounts.
